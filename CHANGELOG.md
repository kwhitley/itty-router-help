## Changelog
Until this library makes it to a production release of v1.x, **minor versions may contain breaking changes to the API**.  After v1.x, semantic versioning will be honored, and breaking changes will only occur under the umbrella of a major version bump.

**v0.3.0** - now just use withHelp, or withHelpIndex direct exports (no createHelp step).
**v0.2.0** - API requires { withHelp, withHelpIndex } = createHelp(rotuer)
